What works:
- User can sign in with username
- User can send in initial main lobby, others can see the message
- User can create a room, room is added to list
- Other users can see this list if they connect before the new room is created (not connecting after)
- Users can send message in this new room, but it will not be sent to other users who joined that room
    - I think users are not joining the same room even though they click on the same room name

TO DO:
- Fix joining rooms
- Password Protected rooms
- Private messages between single users
- Creator of room temporarily ban and permament ban from room
- Username shows when they send a message
- Username of everyone in room is shown
