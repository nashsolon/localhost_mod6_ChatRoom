1. Open in viscose (or just cd into the folder from command line)
2. Type in `node chat-server.js`
3. Go to localhost website:
	http://localhost:3456/

	For others on the same network...
		Go to 172.27.96.139:3456
	For others not on the same network...
		Use ngrok...
			1. Open up one command line, type in `ngrok http <PORT>`
			2. Open up another command line, start the server at port using
			   `node chat-server.js`
			NOTE: ngrok actually has a limit to number of connections so it 			      sucks. Let's try to use local tunnel
		Use local tunnel...
			1. Install local tunnel through `npm install -g localtunnel`
			2. Start server on a local port `lt --port <PORT>`
			3. Voila
